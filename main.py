            Welcome to the Retail Stores Analysis project. This initiative aims to provide
            in-depth insights into retail store performance.
            Our analysis covers key metrics such as sales trends, customer demographics,
            and market share to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

            The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes information from
            retail chains from across different countries such as United States, United Kingdom, and Japan. By examining
            these different markets, we can identify regional trends and opportunities
            for growth.

            #### Project Focus
            Customer and Market analysis within the e-commerce sector. The core focus of the research is customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and exploratory analysis of the product pricing strategies.

            ##### Why is it important:
            * **Actionable Business insights:** By applying the RFM analysis, the project can help the online retailers to identify and cluster customers based on distinct groups. This data-driven foundation is useful for developing targeted marketing strategies, customer retention, stock analysis eventually adding value to customer experience and overall profitability.
            * **Strategic planning and inventory management:** Understanding how product prices are set and how they vary across different years. These insights will help in managing inventory and optimizing companies revenue.

            #### Stakeholders (Who is Affected?)
            Which industries, groups, or individuals are impacted by this issue? What are the real-world implications?
            * **The Business (the retailer):** This is the core stakeholder. Its impacted by sales volume, revenue, profitability, inventory management, and customer retention.
            * **Customers:** These are the individuals making purchases. They are affected by product availability, pricing, shipping costs, delivery times, and the quality of customer service.
            * **Suppliers:** These are the companies providing the products. Their relationship with the retailer is impacted by purchase orders, payment schedules, and demand for their goods.
            * **Logistics and Shipping Companies:** These companies are responsible for delivering goods. Their business is directly tied to the volume and geographical spread of the retailer's sales. The international nature of the sales (e.g., to countries like France, Germany, EIRE, and Norway as seen in the data) highlights the involvement of international logistics partners.

            #### Existing Solutions & Gaps
            What solutions currently exist? What limitations or challenges remain?

            **Paper 1: A Stacking Approach to Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction**
            * **Current Solution:** A two-stage model uses a number of algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, ElasticNet) and a final model that combines their predicted values to produce more accurate CLV forecasting.
            * **Strengths:** More precise using the ensemble of various models; utilizes a rich feature set instead of RFM alone.
            * **Limitations:** Computationally demanding and convoluted; "black box" solution difficult to interpret; requires a lot of data.

            **Paper 2: Customer-Focused Sales Forecasting Model: RFM-ARIMA Methodology**
            * **Current Solution:** A combination solution that first uses RFM analysis in customer segmentation and elimination of noise before ARIMA is used on sales data.
            * **Strengths:** Maximizes accuracy and model fit by reducing data noise.
            * **Limitations:** Restricted for non-linear trend analysis and external factors like seasonality; reliant on large customer buy history data.

            **Paper 3: Development of a Retailer Forecasting Model Based on Customer Segmentation Using Data Mining Techniques**
            * **Current Solution:** Two-stage model that groups customers based on demographic and behavior data and forecasts for each group using a forecasting model.
            * **Strengths:** Improves inventory performance; is customer-focused; eliminates data redundancy.
            * **Limitations:** Can be limited in scope; might be limited to neat, small datasets.

            **Paper 4: Research on E-Commerce Inventory Sales Forecasting Model Based on ARIMA and LSTM Algorithm**
            * **Current Solution:** Two-model strategy with ARIMA for monthly inventory forecasting and LSTM for daily sales forecasting.
            * **Strengths:** Novel approach that improves accuracy; offers actionable solution for warehouse planning.
            * **Weaknesses:** Tested over short time period; LSTMs are prone to overfitting and difficult to interpret; requires large datasets.

    #### 2. Data Cleaning
    The dataset initially contained missing values, duplicates, and negative quantities.  
    We performed several cleaning steps to ensure the integrity of our analysis:
    - Removed transactions with **missing Customer IDs**  
    - Excluded **negative quantities or prices** (which usually indicate returns or errors)  
    - Removed **duplicate entries**  
    - Converted columns such as `InvoiceDate` to proper datetime format  
    - Created a new feature **`TotalSales = Quantity Ã— UnitPrice`**

    #### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    We conducted an in-depth exploration to understand sales patterns, customer segments, and market dynamics.  
    Key observations included:
    - **Sales distribution:** The majority of sales originated from the **United Kingdom**, followed by **Netherlands** and **EIRE**.  
    - **Top-selling products:** Items like decorative lights and gift sets appeared frequently across invoices.  
    - **Customer activity:** A small percentage of customers contributed to a majority of revenue â€” consistent with the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).  
    - **Time trends:** Clear seasonality effects were observed, especially during the holiday months.

    st.info("""
    #### 4. Feature Engineering
    To prepare for modeling and segmentation:
    - Extracted **year, month, and day** from `InvoiceDate`  
    - Aggregated sales per customer to compute **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** metrics  
    - Identified **top-selling countries and products**  
    - Created derived metrics such as **average basket size** and **average order value**
    """)

    st.info("""
    #### 5. Insights and Patterns
    - The **UK market** dominated both sales and customer volume.  
    - Seasonal spikes suggested strong **holiday-driven purchase trends**.  
    - Many customers made **one-time purchases**, but a few frequent buyers accounted for significant revenue.  
    - The cleaned and engineered data provided a strong foundation for segmentation, forecasting, and price optimization in later stages.
