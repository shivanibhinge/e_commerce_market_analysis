# ðŸ§­ The Retail Compass

> **Data-Driven Insights for Smarter E-Commerce Decisions**

The **Retail Compass** is a data-driven initiative that provides actionable business insights for the e-commerce sector.  
Using a comprehensive transactional dataset from an online retail store, we uncover patterns that help retailers **understand customers, optimize inventory, and boost revenue**.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- **Customer Segmentation** â€“ Identify and group customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis.  
- **Pricing & Revenue** â€“ Explore product pricing strategies for better **inventory management** and **revenue optimization**.

## ðŸ§© Existing Solutions & Gaps

Our work builds on existing research while addressing their limitations:

| Paper / Model | Limitation |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Stacking Approach to CLV Prediction** | Accurate but computationally heavy and hard to interpret (*black-box*). |
| **Customer-Focused Sales Forecasting (RFM-ARIMA)** | Handles accuracy well but struggles with **non-linear trends** and **seasonality**. |
| **Retailer Forecasting via Customer Segmentation** | Improves inventory performance but limited in overall scope. |
| **E-Commerce Inventory Forecasting (ARIMA + LSTM)** | Great accuracy for monthly/daily forecasting but prone to **overfitting** and requires large datasets. |

**âœ… Our Approach:** Combine these analytical methods to deliver a **holistic, practical solution**.
